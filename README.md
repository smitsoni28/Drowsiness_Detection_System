# Drowsiness_Detection_System
The report discusses the development of an image processing algorithm for a non-intrusive device that can detect driver fatigue and provide timely alerts to prevent road accidents. The device uses a camera to track the driver's eye movements and predicts their fatigue symptoms. The report highlights that drowsiness is a major contributor to road accidents, accounting for about 20% of serious incidents. The use of image processing allows for early detection of drowsiness without the need for invasive monitoring methods. The device will help improve road safety by providing timely alerts to drivers who are becoming fatigued by buzzing an alarm.
